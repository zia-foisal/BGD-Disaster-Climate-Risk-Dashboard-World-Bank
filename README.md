# About Bangladesh Disaster and Climate Risk Dashboard

**Bangladesh** is currently among the countries most affected by extreme weather events globally.The long-term Climate Risk Index (CRI) ranks Bangladesh as the **7th most at-risk country** over the 2000-2019 period, with 173 extreme events recorded (CRI 2021). Global climate projections of temperature and precipitation, compounded by the degradation of the environment, due to land use patterns and unplanned urban development, indicate that even under the most optimistic global climate scenario, Bangladesh will continue to disproportionately – and more frequently and intensely – suffer from extreme weather events and long-term climatic changes.

**However, Disaster and climate Risk are not uniform across space**.It is a function of the probability and intensity with which a hazard occurs, and the exposure of people and assets to this hazard, both of which differ strongly across geographies. Moreover, socioeconomic conditions, driving vulnerability, are also highly heterogeneous at small scales, making communities and households more, or less, vulnerable in the face of climate change.

The analytics in this dashboard zoom in to the level of granular administrative units, where investment decisions are made and local policy should be targeted. **This dashboard focuses on disaster risk from floods, heat stress, droughts, landslides, tropical cyclone, and air pollution**.These pose a critical disaster and climate risk concern for Bangladesh, and indeed across large parts of South Asia. To assess and quantify the impact of these hazards, whether extreme events or long-term climatic changes **three types of exposure:** are considered - 

1. Population,
2. Built-up assets, and
3. Agricultural land

Where available, an impact function is added to the exposure variables,to demonstrate the expected annual impact on population health in terms of morbidity and mortality, the potential damage to built-up assets and to agricultural land. Vulnerability is then captured by a series of, **socioeconomic indicators and development outcomes**, tailored to specific hazards.
